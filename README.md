Trying to build some charts using Nuxt js, Chart js

this is first time I am trying to use one of the JAMStack example. Nuxt js is a library built based on Vue js.

# App Features

1. fetching data from rest api using @nuxtjs/axios
2. client side and server side caching

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
